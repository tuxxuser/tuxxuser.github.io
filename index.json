On a straight through cable, the wired pins match. Notice that only pins 1, 2, 3, and 6 are used. Connect 1 to 1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, and 6 to 6 and you’ll be up and networking in no time. Just remember that this would be a 10/100 Ethernet-only cable, so it wouldn’t work with 1000 Mbps Ethernet, voice, Token Ring, ISDN, and so on.\nStraight through cable use one wiring standard: both ends use T568A wiring standard or both ends use T568B wiring standard.

Crossover cables can be used to connect these devices:\nSwitch to switch Hub to hub Host to host Hub to switch Router direct to host A crossover Ethernet cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly. Unlike straight through cable, the RJ45 crossover cable uses two different wiring standards. One end uses the T568A wiring standard, and the other end uses the T568B wiring standard.

Pin 2 of Connector A (Side One) would be connected to Pin 7 of Connector B (Side Two) and so on.
